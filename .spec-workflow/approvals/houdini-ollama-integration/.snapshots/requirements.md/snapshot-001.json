The feature will ensure end users can configure and use local Ollama models inside Houdini exactly as they do in the desktop Cherry Studio application.\r\n\r\n## Alignment with Product Vision\r\n\r\nCherry Studio aims to deliver a consistent AI assistant experience across environments. Guaranteeing that the Houdini port shares feature parity with the desktop app—especially for local model management—supports the overall vision of a seamless, high-performance workflow for technical artists and TDs.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n### Requirement 1\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a Houdini user running the Cherry Studio plugin, I want the embedded frontend to detect and use the Qt WebChannel bridge reliably so that backend APIs (e.g., ping, network calls) are always available after load.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the plugin window loads THEN the console SHALL log a successful WebChannel-ready event and the backend SHALL receive a ping call.\r\n2. IF WebChannel objects fail to initialize THEN the system SHALL retry initialization and surface a descriptive error without crashing Houdini.\r\n3. WHEN the frontend calls any exposed Qt API (e.g., `window.qt.api.ping`) THEN the backend SHALL respond without throwing undefined errors.\r\n\r\n### Requirement 2\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a technical director, I want the plugin to list my local Ollama models from Houdini so that I can select and use them in Cherry Studio’s UI.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN the user opens the model management view for Ollama THEN the system SHALL return the model list fetched from the local Ollama endpoint.\r\n2. IF the local Ollama service is unreachable THEN the system SHALL surface a user-facing error message and backend logs SHALL capture the failure reason.\r\n3. WHEN the Ollama list is fetched successfully THEN the UI SHALL display the same models as the desktop Cherry Studio client.\r\n\r\n### Requirement 3\r\n\r\n**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the plugin, I want clear diagnostics around WebChannel and network calls so that regressions can be identified quickly.\r\n\r\n#### Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n1. WHEN WebChannel initialization occurs THEN logs SHALL include which objects were exposed and whether retry logic was used.\r\n2. IF network proxy calls are invoked from the frontend THEN backend logs SHALL record the requested URL, method, and result status.\r\n3. WHEN errors occur (WebChannel or network) THEN the system SHALL avoid Houdini crashes and instead emit structured error logs.\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\r\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Keep WebChannel bootstrap, network proxying, and frontend stubs in clearly separated modules or sections.\r\n- **Modular Design**: Provide reusable helper utilities for request logging and fallback handling.\r\n- **Dependency Management**: Avoid introducing new heavy dependencies; rely on standard Qt/PySide6 facilities.\r\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Document the contract for exposed Qt APIs and frontend usage (e.g., expected JSON formats).\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Ensure WebChannel initialization and Ollama queries execute without introducing noticeable UI lag (>200ms overhead).\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n- Limit network proxying to localhost targets and validate/whitelist URLs to prevent arbitrary external requests.\r\n\r\n### Reliability\r\n- Implement graceful fallback logic that keeps Houdini running even if Ollama is offline or WebChannel initialization fails initially.\r\n\r\n### Usability\r\n- Provide actionable log messages for users and developers, enabling quick troubleshooting without diving into source code.\r\n",
